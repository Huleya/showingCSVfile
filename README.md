showingCSVfile
==============
Hi. This is a little web example using some jquery functions.
I found some of the code here.
http://loquemesaledelospeones.blogspot.com/2012/01/3-2-1-tabla-con-filtro-crear-una-tabla.html


I did an php import code inside the html file and the javascript makes the filtering issue.

Objectives:

* Make an easy way to publish a .csv file content.

* Make possible to filter and search some information within.

* **Make future version without php**
(So you can upload your information to a dropbox or googledrive
folder and use it in an easy way). 

Code used:

- php: imports de csv file, parse the data and prints html code.
- js: jquery and the extra function --> makes the filtering function.
